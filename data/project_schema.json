      "markdown": "## Why I built this\n\nTeams kept context-switching between logs, deploy feeds, and runbooks. Signalboard turns those streams into one readable command center.\n\n## Architecture notes\n\n- Event ingestion through a lightweight queue\n- Aggregation service for alert grouping\n- Frontend stream layer for live updates\n\n## What I learned\n\nI improved my data modeling instincts and got comfortable balancing expressive UI with strict performance budgets.",
